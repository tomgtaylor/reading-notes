# What is Wireframing

A wireframe is essentially a simple 2D display of one's page.

This wirefram enables users to create a design layout/diagram and plan for a website or app. In short, it's basically a minimal drawing of what the website or app will look like, which enables the designer to write code accordingly.

## Making a wireframe
