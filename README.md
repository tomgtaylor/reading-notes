# Growth Mindset: What is it?

### Growth mindset refers to the perception that one can improve their ability via hard work and effort.

### There are a few ways one can keep a growth mindset:
1. Embrace challenges.
2. Use mistakes as a learning opportunity.
3. Learn to accept constructive feedback.
4. Learn to give constructive feedback.

**In the words of Steve Jobs:**,
