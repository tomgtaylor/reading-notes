# Class 5: CSS Reading Notes

What is CSS for?

As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

- CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.

The CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case, we are styling level one headings h1.

We then have a set of curly braces { }.

## Three Ways to Insert CSS

- There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

  -  External CSS
  -  Internal CSS
  -  Inline CSS

**External CSS**: In CSS. Linked into HTML via a "link" tag.

**Internal CSS**: In HTML. Within a style tag. Internal will override external rules.

**Inline CSS**: In the HTML tag itself. Overrides External and Internal.

CSS Rule: *External < Internal < Inline*
